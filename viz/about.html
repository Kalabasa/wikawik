      <h2>Disclaimers and more information</h2>
      <p>
        Information presented in the web app is not guaranteed to be accurate.
        They were derived from public datasets of PSA and KWF. The PSA census
        tends to merge different minority languages into one, misrepresenting
        them. For example, various Aeta languages have been merged into one
        label called "Aeta/Agta". Another one is the lumping of Bicol languages
        into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were also many inconsistencies, even between PSA and KWF,
        especially on the classification of dialects versus languages. In order
        to get better representation of each language in the Philippines, I have
        modified the dataset based on other sources, such as Ethnologue and
        Glottolog. In the end, the goal was to showcase the languages of the
        Philippines and promote preservation of cultural heritage. Numbers are
        secondary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translated phrases were sourced from multiple places, such as Internet
        lists, language tutorials, chatter in public Facebook groups of
        tribespeople, bilingual dictionaries, and translated Bibles made by
        missionaries for indigenous people. If you are a native speaker or an
        expert, please let me know of any errors through the feedback form.

        Placement of markers (the person icon) on the map is only accurate to
        the provincial level. Within the province, they are scattered randomly.
        The marker might not exactly tell where the language is spoken within
        the province. This is evident in large provinces, like Quezon and
        Zamboanga del Sur.
      </p>

        For simplicity, spelling is standardized using the Latin alphabet + Ñ,
        also known as the Filipino Alphabet. Diacritics are not added. It is
        important to note that not all Philippine languages are pronounced like
        Tagalog (i.e., pronounced plainly as spelled). There are some languages
        that have more than 5 vowels and cannot be fully expressed using the
        standard Filipino Alphabet. For example, in Aklanon, the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voiced_velar_fricative.ogg"
          target="_blank"
          >“e”</a
        >
        in <em>“Akeanon”</em> is pronounced as a consonant that sounds like
        something between “r” and “l”. In some other languages, like Maranao,
        the “e” may be pronounced as an
        <a
          href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mid-central_vowel.ogg"
          target="_blank"
          >“uh”</a
        >
        (schwa), as in <em>“Meranaw“</em>. In other words, beware of “e”s.
        Ortograpiyang Pambansa prescribes spelling this as “ë”. Please consult a
        native speaker for proper pronunciation. Don’t try this at home.
